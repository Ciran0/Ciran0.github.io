        <h2>Exploring a Lightweight and Embeddable Scripting Language</h2>
        <p>
            My interest in Lua began with my journey into Neovim customization, but it quickly grew into an appreciation for the language itself. Lua's simplicity, speed, and ease of integration make it a powerful tool for a variety of applications, from game development to embedded systems.
        </p>
        <h2>Areas of Exploration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Using Lua to write complex configurations and plugins for Neovim.</li>
            <li>Developing small standalone scripts to automate personal tasks.</li>
            <li>Understanding its data structures, especially the versatile 'table' type.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Code Examples</h2>
        <p>Here are a couple of snippets that illustrate Lua's clean syntax and functionality.</p>
        <!-- Code Snippet 1: A simple function -->
        <pre class="code-snippet"><code>-- A simple function to greet a user
function greet(name)
  return "Hello, " .. name .. "!"
end

print(greet("Developer")) -- Output: Hello, Developer!</code></pre>
        <!-- Code Snippet 2: A configuration table -->
        <pre class="code-snippet"><code>-- Example of a Lua table used for configuration
local config = {
  user = "Ciran",
  theme = "dark",
  plugins_enabled = true,
  settings = {
    font_size = 14,
    line_numbers = true
  }
}

-- Accessing nested values
if config.settings.line_numbers then
  print("Line numbers are enabled for user: " .. config.user)
end</code></pre>
        <p>
            Learning Lua has provided me with a practical scripting language that complements my existing skills in Python and Shell scripting, opening up new avenues for development and automation.
