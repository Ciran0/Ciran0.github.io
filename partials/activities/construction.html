        <h2>A Summer of Hands-On, Practical Work</h2>
        <p>
            Working in construction was a formative experience that taught me the value of hard work, precision, and teamwork in a physically demanding environment. It offered a different perspective on problem-solving, where challenges are immediate and tangible.
        </p>
        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhanced teamwork and communication skills, essential for coordinating tasks on a busy site.</li>
            <li>Development of a strong work ethic and resilience under pressure.</li>
            <li>Practical understanding of project planning and execution from a non-IT perspective.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While different from my IT focus, this work instilled a practical mindset and a respect for skilled trades that I believe is beneficial in any professional field.
