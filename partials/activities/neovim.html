        <h2>Adopting a Modern, Extensible Text Editor</h2>
        <p>
            Transitioning to Neovim was a significant step in optimizing my development workflow. Its modal editing philosophy presented a steep learning curve, but the efficiency gains have been well worth the effort. I've embraced its extensibility, customizing my setup with plugins for everything from code completion to Git integration.

        <h2>Core Skills Developed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Proficiency in modal editing, leading to faster and more precise code manipulation.</li>
            <li>Experience with Lua for configuring the editor and writing custom plugins.</li>
            <li>Ability to create a fully personalized and efficient development environment tailored to my needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This journey has not only improved my speed as a developer but has also given me a powerful tool that I can shape to handle any programming task.
